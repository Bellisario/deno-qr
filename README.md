Feel free to contribute and add new features. :octocat:

## Current Roadmap :memo:

- [x] Base project
- [ ] QrCode resize option
- [ ] Feel free to suggest new ones

## Why I created this? :question:

I know this is a really simple project but I made this because:

- I liked to show the power :battery: of Deno + Deno Deploy <img src="https://deno.land/logo.svg" width="20" height="20" alt="little-deno" />

- I wanted to create a simple and fast :racing_car: QrCode generator server
- I wanted to learn Deno Deploy and how it works :monocle_face:
