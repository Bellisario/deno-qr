> Production URL here: https://deno-qr.deno.dev/ \

Feel free to contribute and new features. :octocat:

## Current Roadmap
- [x] Base project
- [ ] QrCode resize option
- [ ] Feel free to suggest new ones

## Why I created this?
I know this is a really simple project but I made this because:
- I liked to show the power of Deno + Deno Deploy :deno:
- I wanted to create a simple and fast QrCode generator server
- I wanted to learn Deno Deploy and how it works
